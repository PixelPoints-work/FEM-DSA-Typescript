# FEM-DSA-Typescript

Im following the Front end masters DSA course in typescript taught by theprimeagen.
Any algorithm in this file is an algorithm that I can implement at a basic level without looking it up.
The practice file is a place where I will practice every algorithm I know on weekly basis at minimum.

Studying DSA is an eye opening experience. It is a foundational peice for understanding CS.

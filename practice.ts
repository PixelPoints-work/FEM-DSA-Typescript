// This file will be used for timed practice to see how fast I can implement the algorithms
// and problems that I know. It takes me a couple of days to learn an new algorithm. There
// should be multiple timed trials with the same amount of algorithms and problems used.
// The time will be recorded with a stop watch and in the git commit message to track progress.
